                <span>1983: eCash</span>
                <p>Although Bitcoin didn’t become a giant overnight, it was quick to become the most recognizable
                    crypto. In the first 25 years of digital currency, the stage was set to allow Bitcoin and other
                    currencies to take the stage.
                    In 1983, David Chaum developed eCash. The goal of the platform was to allow people to transfer money
                    anonymously over the internet. An early champion of digital privacy advocacy he used cryptographic
                    technology to allow blind signatures to keep interaction private and secure. This became essential
                    to future currencies, putting the “crypto” in cryptocurrency.

                <span>1998: Crypto is Coined</span>
                <p>The term cryptocurrency was officially established in 1998, the same year DigiCash went bankrupt.
                    During this time Wei Dai was pushing B-money, as he pushed a crypto model focusing on
                    decentralization. Although the term cryptocurrency outlasted B-money, Wei Dai would go on to be one
                    of the most important names in crypto.
                    <br>
                    Today, the Wei -the smallest unit of Ether- is named after Dai. His concept of a decentralized
                    payment system using cryptography is a cornerstone of all modern cryptocurrencies.

                <span>2008: Economic Crisis Strikes</span>
                <p>
                    The ‘08 economic collapse shook the foundations of the financial industry. The value of traditional
                    money decreased at the same time that public trust in banks and financial institutions began to
                    waiver. Inherent flaws in the existing systems were exposed and people were looking for a new
                    answer.
                    <br>
                    This set the stage for a public that was more ready to adopt a decentralized alternative. Satoshi
                    Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, cites this period as his inspiration, even referencing the bank
                    bailout in Bitcoin’s genesis block.

                <h3>2009-2017: Bitcoin Birth to Boom</h3>
                <span>2009: Bitcoin</span>
                <p>
                    During this period, Bitcoin went from being the only cryptocurrency anyone had heard of (if they had
                    even heard of cryptocurrency at all!) to being the hottest new investment opportunity on the
                    block(chain). Although it was hardly the only coin out there, Bitcoin had begun to pull crypto into
                    the public lens.
                    <br>
                    Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of the still unknown creator, releases Bitcoin. He strove to show
                    that another time of currency is possible, allowing for international and decentralized use without
                    relying on any financial institution. To many, it seemed a pipedream at the time, but history (and
                    the near future) would be kind to Nakamoto.

                <span>2010: Bitcoin Valuation</span>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin’s first true valuation came when it was sold for the first time. And as with many great
                    things, it started with pizza.

                    The first Bitcoin sale famously exchanged 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. At current prices, that would
                    have been worth more than $300 million, enough to buy the pizza franchise multiple times over.
                    Still, this is an important moment as it finally makes it possible to assign Bitcoin a true monetary
                    value.

                <p>
                    In October 2012, one of the world’s most recognized exchanges, Coinbase Global Inc (or simply
                    Coinbase), launched. The exchange was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam and reached 1
                    million users by 2014. Today, it is the largest exchange by trading volume.

                <p>
                    The only coin to truly come close to rivaling Bitcoin is Ethereum. The platform goes beyond
                    currency, generating smart contracts and applications through blockchain. It is the biggest mover in
                    using crypto to enhance business processes using the same secure model of authentication. This would
                    prove to offer more value to banks and large enterprises, making crypto more appealing to them in
                    the near future.

                <p>
                    Bitcoin hits $10,000 USD, a long way from paying 10k BTC for two pizzas! Although steady growth had
                    been going for years, hitting this benchmark along with the boost from the previous year’s halvening
                    spun the world into a Bitcoin frenzy.
                    <br>
                    Early investors were bragging about their new wealth and new investors were looking for any
                    opportunity to cash in. Meanwhile, big banks were taking notice and the fintech industry exploded
                    with new uses for blockchain technology.

                    Cryptocurrency became truly proven, finally recognized as one of the biggest markets for both
                    traditional and alternative investors. Investors across the world would enter telegram groups asking
                    founders and other investors in token project the typical phrase, “when moon?”

                    Large enterprises and financial institutions start to make massive investments into cryptocurrency.
                    Ethereum becomes a major focus as its additional services and smart contracts can improve
                    efficiency, speed, security, and automation. Microsoft launches a blockchain service so users can
                    compile and deploy Ethereum contracts.

                    Other Fortune 500 companies continue to buy into Ethereum over the next few years including JP
                    Morgan, Chase, Amazon, IBM, and Walmart.

                <p>
                    Although cryptocurrency lending was already happening it went mainstream midway through 2020. An
                    economic crash resulting from the worldwide pandemic leads to falling interest rates and lending
                    opportunities plummeting. Investors start looking for other opportunities and crypto is there to
                    pick up the slack.

                    Cryptocurrency loans give access to fiat currencies, helping to make them a new standard for
                    generating passive income.

                <p>
                    The total market cap of cryptocurrency passes $2 Trillion USD. Once seen as a speculative

                    generating income are rapidly emerging. Crypto’s place in the market is cemented. And while changes
